Discussion
This project explored various data analytics techniques on a stroke prediction dataset, aiming to gain insights and develop models for prediction and clustering. Key highlights of the analysis include:

Data Preparation:

Missing values were handled effectively using imputation techniques.
Outliers were addressed using capping to ensure data consistency.
Feature scaling and encoding prepared the data for machine learning algorithms.
Descriptive Analytics:

Identified significant differences in numerical features like age, BMI, and glucose levels between stroke and non-stroke cases.
Highlighted categorical features, such as hypertension and heart disease, which exhibited strong associations with stroke.
Classification:

Various algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM) were applied to predict stroke occurrence.
Random Forest emerged as the best-performing model, with the highest accuracy and AUC score.
Insights revealed the importance of features like hypertension, glucose levels, and age in predicting stroke.
Regression:

The task of predicting BMI demonstrated the effectiveness of Random Forest Regressor, outperforming Linear Regression in all evaluation metrics.
Residual analysis suggested that Random Forest handled non-linear relationships effectively.
Clustering:

K-Means clustering identified distinct subgroups in the data based on age and glucose levels.
These clusters can guide targeted interventions or deeper analysis, such as identifying at-risk populations for high glucose levels.
Limitations:

The dataset had imbalances in target classes, potentially impacting classification performance.
K-Means assumes spherical clusters, which may not fully capture complex relationships in the data.
The analysis was limited to a subset of features, and additional dimensions could provide richer insights.
Conclusion
This project successfully applied a combination of descriptive, predictive, and clustering techniques to analyze the stroke prediction dataset. The key findings and results include:

Descriptive Insights: Strong correlations between stroke and features like hypertension, heart disease, and glucose levels were observed, setting the foundation for predictive modeling.
Classification Models: Random Forest proved to be the most effective classifier for stroke prediction, achieving high performance metrics and demonstrating the importance of non-linear feature interactions.
Regression Analysis: The Random Forest Regressor performed best in predicting BMI, suggesting its ability to handle complex relationships in continuous data.
Clustering Results: K-Means clustering provided actionable insights by segmenting the population into distinct subgroups, highlighting patterns in glucose levels and age.
Future Work
To build upon the current analysis:

Address class imbalances using techniques like oversampling or undersampling.
Incorporate additional features, such as lifestyle factors, to enrich model predictions and clustering insights.
Experiment with advanced algorithms like Gradient Boosting, DBSCAN, or Neural Networks for enhanced performance.
Validate models and clusters with external datasets to ensure generalizability.
Final Note
The project demonstrates how data analytics can provide actionable insights into healthcare datasets, guiding targeted interventions and decision-making. The results provide a solid foundation for further exploration and improvement in stroke prediction and prevention strategies.
